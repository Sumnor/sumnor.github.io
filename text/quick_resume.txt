I am a Research Scientist at the University of Luxembourg, working at the interface of physics, chemistry, and materials science.
My research focuses on advancing machine learning force fields (MLFFs) to achieve accurate, transferable, and interpretable atomistic simulations.
Currently, I am developing next-generation MLFF architectures that incorporate robust prediction uncertainty quantification and active learning across configurational and chemical spaces.
By combining principles of quantum mechanics, statistical physics, and modern machine learning, my work seeks to push the boundaries of predictive modeling for molecules and materials under realistic conditions.
